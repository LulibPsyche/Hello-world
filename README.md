# Hello-world
This is one of the first drafts of my recent project.
As an enthusiast about psychology and student of the subject, i found my self wondering about the necessitis of discussion of critical matters in organizational psychology in the society that we live in, seling our selfs as a product.
So this website will become my space to talk about those themes and a way to share my resume while puting interestings discussions on the table.
